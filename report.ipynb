    "As expected, Gurobi MIP solver yields the optimal solutions in a reasonable time. Greedy heuristic is the fastest solver but doesn't deliver the optimal solution. In the other hand, genetic algorithm is both slowest and the worst in the mean of optimality of the solutions. Only the graphs with the sparse set of edges is better in the genetic algorithm, compared to greedy heuristic. In the dense graphs, genetic algorithm failed to find optimal solutions, this probably caused by the loss of randomness. k=1 bit flip for the mutation is not enough and probably repaired after the mutation. Also, all of the solving process has been aborted because of the K=20 generations. Some of the processes, specially the ones with the sparse graphs, has not been improved since first generation, which is the initial population (see the last cells of <ins>**main.ipynb**</ins>). This shows the loss of randomness once again. The larger size of population is significantly better in the genetic algorithms for this problem, but takes more time as expected. The bigger number of maximum generations has no effect because of the abortion by K=20.\n",
